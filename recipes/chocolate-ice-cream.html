    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g of dark chocolate (at lest 70% cocoa solids) chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>500ml of double cream</li>
        <li>340g can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons organic cocoa powder sifted</li>
        <li>50g milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>sea salt flakes (optional extra for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of just-simmering water, ensuring 
            the bowl doesn’t touch the water, or do this in the microwave in 20-second bursts until 
            smooth and glossy. Leave to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream, condensed milk and vanilla into a second bowl and beat for 3 mins using an 
            electric whisk until slightly thickened and the beaters leave a trail in the mixture when 
            lifted across the bowl. Be careful not to overwhip, as you don’t want the mixture to be too 
            stiff – as soon as the beaters leave a trail, it’s ready.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the melted chocolate and cocoa powder into the cream mixture until thoroughly 
            combined, ensuring the spatula is reaching the bottom of the bowl so all the chocolate gets 
            mixed in. Fold in most of the chocolate chips, reserving a small handful.</li>
        <li>Scrape the mixture into a 1-litre freezerproof container, then scatter over the reserved 
            chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Cover and freeze for at least 6 hrs until firm but scoopable. <em>Will keep frozen for up to 
            a month.</em></li>
        <li>To serve, scoop the ice cream into chilled bowls or ice cream cones and sprinkle with a pinch 
            of sea salt, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
