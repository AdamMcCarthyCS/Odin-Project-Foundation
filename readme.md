A project to build a recipe webpage with five recipes. The main skills I'm working on are:
- Write HTML
    - Use appropriate attributes: ref, alt, src, href, width, etc.
    - Use headers and paragraphs for displaying text
    - Make working links for navigating the page
    - Display images throughout the project
    - Use bolded text, ordered and unordered lists with appropriate accessibility tags
    - Write comments explaining logic
- Folder structure
    - Use an index page with a pages folder for other pages, img folder for images
- Git commit history
    - Write atomic commits using the conventional commits structure
