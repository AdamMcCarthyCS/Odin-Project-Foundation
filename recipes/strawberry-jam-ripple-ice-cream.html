    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600ml double cream</li>
        <li>395g can condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 a lemon (zested and juiced)</li>
        <li>200g soft-set strawberry jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the double cream using an electric whisk until it holds its shape. Keep beating 
            on a lower speed and gradually pour in the condensed milk and vanilla extract, then 
            slowly add the lemon zest and juice. Put the mixture in a shallow baking tin or container 
            that will fit in your freezer.</li>
        <li>Drop the jam all over the surface in little blobs using a teaspoon, then drag a skewer 
            through the blobs to spread it out a little. Some jam will disappear from the surface 
            but that’s okay.</li>
        <li>Cover the container and put it in the freezer for at least 3 hrs. This is a soft-set 
            ice cream, so you don’t need to take it out of the freezer too far ahead of serving. 
            <em>Will keep in the freezer for up to three months.</em></li>
    </ol>
